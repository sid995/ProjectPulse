## Architecture Overview

ProjectPulse follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for clear separation of concerns and modularity:

### Backend Architecture
1. **API Layer:** HTTP handlers and middleware using Gin
2. **Service Layer:** Business logic and service implementations
3. **Repository Layer:** Data access and persistence using GORM
4. **Domain Layer:** Core business entities and domain logic
5. **Infrastructure Layer:** External systems integration (email, storage, etc.)

### Frontend Architecture
1. **Pages:** Next.js page components
2. **Components:** Reusable UI components
3. **Hooks:** Custom React hooks for shared logic
4. **Services:** API service integrations
5. **Contexts:** Global state management
6. **Utils:** Helper functions and utilities

## Database Schema

ProjectPulse uses PostgreSQL with the following core entities:
- Users
- Projects
- Teams
- Tickets/Issues
- Comments
- Activity Logs
- Notifications

Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data and managing session information.
